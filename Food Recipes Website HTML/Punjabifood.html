        <div id="rec1"><img src="Images/paneer butter masala.jpg" alt="" width="500px"><h2>Paneer Butter Masala</h2><p>This Paneer Butter Masala recipe is a rich and creamy dish of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) in a tomato, butter and cashew sauce that is known here as “makhani gravy.” The acidity of the tomatoes and the sweetness of the cream make for a velvety, nearly addictive sauce. Also known as “Butter Paneer,” this yummy and popular vegetarian dish is derived from the recipe for Butter Chicken, a.k.a. Chicken Makhani, that I learned to make during my cooking school days.

<div id="rec2"><img src="Images/palak paneer.jpg" alt="" width="500px"><h1>Palak Paneer</h1><p>Palak Paneer is one of the most popular Indian dish made with succulent Paneer cubes (Indian cottage cheese) in a smooth spinach sauce. I share two ways to make this healthy dish – a homestyle version and a restaurant style version with a charcoal smoking method (brought back on reader’s demand). Both the vibrant green palak paneer recipes are made with fresh spinach leaves (palak in Hindi), aromatics, herbs and spices. Make these super delicious spinach paneer recipes with my easy step-by-step photo guide and video.Palak Paneer is one of the most popular Indian curries around, and with good reason. This deliciously creamy and vibrantly green dish is made with paneer in a mildly spiced fresh spinach sauce. This is a delightful and easy to make vegetarian main you just have to try!This delicious palak paneer is a family recipe that my Mom passed down to me. She has been making this recipe for our family for years, and I am so happy to get to share it with you here. It is one of the most popular and well-liked spinach paneer recipe on the blog, not to mention our favorite at home. Packed with healthy nutrients like calcium, iron and vitamin C, this is a meal that I can feel good about eating.Saag paneer and palak paneer are terms that are often used interchangeably, but they are actually different dishes. Palak paneer is an authentic Indian dish made with only spinach puree, whereas saag paneer is made with a mixture of 2 to 3 various types of greens.In the Punjabi or Hindi language the word ‘saag’ means greens, and ‘palak’ means spinach. Various leafy greens fall under this category of ‘saag’, including: amaranth leaves, spinach, dill leaves, radish leaves, mustard leaves, fenugreek leaves and purslane.</p></div>

<div id="rec3"><img src="Images/dal makhni.jpg" alt="" width="500px"><h2>Dal Makhni</h2><p>This Dal Makhani recipe is a restaurant style version with subtle smoky flavors and creaminess of the lentils. If you love authentic Punjabi food then you are going to love this Dal Makhani even more. Dal Makhani is one of the most popular lentil recipes from the North Indian Punjabi cuisine made with Whole Black Lentils (known as Urad dal or Kaali Dal in Hindi) and Kidney Beans (known as Rajma in Hindi).For this recipe, I have used a pressure cooker to cook the lentils, but I have explained the method of cooking the lentils in a pan or pot in the notes section of the recipe card.In my experimentation with this dish earlier, I remember making dal makhani without whole spices many times and hoping to get restaurant like taste and flavors in the lentils. But it never matched and my experiments continued. When we were residing in Goa, we used to have dal makhani in a restaurant (and it was one of their best dish) at the quiet and serene Benaulim beachI once found a black cardamom and clove in their dal makhni. I thought may be it is the black cardamom and clove giving that lovely aroma and flavor.Thereafter I tested dal makhani many times adding whole spices and realized that they do add a good flavor and faint aroma to the dish. But I still felt something was lacking.</p></div>

<div id="rec4"><img src="Images/matar paneer.jpg" alt="" width="500px"><h2>Matar Paneer</h2><p>Matar paneer recipe is a popular Indian Curry dish made with green peas and Paneer (Indian cottage cheese) in a base of onions, tomatoes, cashews, spices and herbs. The recipe hails from the versatile Northern Indian cuisine that has many different (and delicious) variations. I’m sharing our family recipe of a flavorful and simple home-style mutter paneer that you are going to like.This simple homemade Matar Paneer is a family recipe spiced to perfection and cooked with green peas (matar or mutter in Hindi), and paneer which is Indian cottage cheese. It is also known as Matar Paneer ki Sabji in Hindi.It is a tasty Indian dish that I make often, as matar paneer – also known as mattar or mutter paneer is one of the most popular dishes from the North Indian cuisine.I have been making this recipe for YEARS. I originally learned how to make it at my in-laws’ home – a classic Punjabi recipe that was simple, easy, and absolutely fuss-free!I share three ways of making this dish – Stove-top pressure cooker (with step-by-step photo guide), in the Instant Pot and in a pan or skillet on the stove-top (whose instructions I have listed in the recipe card below).</p></div>

<div id="rec5"><img src="Images/kadai paneer.jpg" alt="" width="500px"><h2>Kadai Paneer</h2><p>Kadai Paneer is a vibrant, tangy, deeply spiced paneer recipe that is perfect for enjoying all year round. Made with pantry staples like onions, tomatoes, capsicum (green bell peppers) and Indian spices, this bright dish comes together in 30 minutes. I share two ways to make this curry – a semi dry restaurant style version and a spicy home style gravy.As the name suggests, Kadai Paneer is a recipe using Indian style cottage cheese a.k.a Paneer which is a soft cheese that does not melt.Paneer is a fresh cheese made by curdling milk with lemon juice or vinegar. Unlike American style cottage cheese that is loose and has individual curds, paneer is firm (like tofu), non-melting and can be easily cut into cubes.Due to its texture, paneer makes an excellent addition in many Indian curry recipes like Paneer Butter Masala, Palak Paneer, Shahi Paneer and Matar Paneer.The word kadai refers to a humble piece of Indian cookware; a kadai is similar to a Chinese wok, but with steeper sides and more depth. This entire dish is made in the kadai, and thus the dish is named “Kadai Paneer” or “Karahi Paneer”.Aside from the paneer itself, the three quintessential ingredients added to kadai paneer are: onions, capsicum (green bell peppers) and tomatoes.</p></div>

<div id="rec6"><img src="Images/naan.jpg" alt="" width="500px"><h2>Naan</h2><p>Make these Naan that are deliciously soft and slightly chewy made without yeast. Naan are flatbreads made with leavened dough and popular in India and some South Asian countries. My tried and tested recipe is for you if you find that using yeast is a daunting affair. So this Naan recipe fits in as it is incredibly easy to make. You can cook naan on a griddle (tawa) or a skillet on a stovetop. Alternatively grill them in a tandoor or oven. Here I show 2 ways of roasting them – on the stove-top with direct flame and on the skillet.Naan is a leavened flatbread made in some countries in Asia. These breads are baked in a tandoor (a cylindrical oven made of clay). It is also popular in India and is served in almost all the restaurants here.Naan is such a delish bread that it makes you forget about all-purpose flour.  I do make whole wheat naan, but sometimes the family wants soft textured naan made with all-purpose flour, the way they are made in restaurants. So I combine both whole wheat flour and all-purpose flour to make naan – like in this recipe of Garlic Naan.Preferably naan bread should be eaten hot for best taste and texture. As once it cools down then it becomes dense, hard and loses its taste. At least the restaurant ones become like that. Not this recipe. The naan bread remains soft and slightly chewy even when they become warm or cool.</p></div>
