This Idli recipe is one of the earliest recipe from the blog which has been tried and tested with great results by many of our readers.Idli is a soft, pillowy steamed savory cake made from fermented rice and lentil batter. The lentils used in making the idli batter are urad dal (hulled black gram).Black gram is also known as matpe beans, urad beans. To make idli the off white colored husked/hulled black gram is used – it can be split or whole.The lentils and rice are soaked first and then later ground separately. The batters are mixed together and seasoned with salt.The batter is allowed to ferment until it increases in volume. Later the batter is steamed in a special and unique cookware traditionally used for making idli.Firstly there are two basic ways you can make idli with the traditional method of soaking the ingredients, grinding them to a batter and fermenting.Of course there are many variations you can do with the basic batter like adding spices, herbs, veggies etc but the basic, simple fermented batter is made with rice or idli rava and urad dal.</p></div>

    <div id="rec3"><img src="Images/upma.jpg" alt="" width="450px"><h2>Upma</h2><p>Upma is a popular South Indian breakfast made with cream of wheat or semolina flour (called rava or suji locally), veggies, spices and herbs. The upma recipe I share here is adapted from my mom’s recipe and continues to be a favorite in my home. The ingredients used to flavor the rava upma (also called suji ka upma) give it a deliciously satisfying taste that will make this dish one of your new preferred go-to breakfasts.Upma is a flavorful, tasty, savory and popular South Indian breakfast that is made with cream of wheat or semolina flour (called rava or suji), a few lentils, nuts, vegetables, herbs and spices.This traditional dish involves cooking roasted rava in water that has been flavored by ghee (or oil), cashews, urad dal (white lentils), chana dal (husked and split bengal gram), onion, ginger and additional herbs and spices. Sugar can be added for a mildly sweet and savory dish.This steaming hot breakfast dish can be made vegan by using oil instead of ghee. Full of warmth, flavor and deliciousness, this upma tastes so good. So why not take a break from that boring oatmeal and try something new? You can’t lose!The main ingredient in any upma recipe is rava. Also called ‘suji’ or ‘sooji‘ in Hindi and ‘cream of wheat’ or ‘semolina’ in English, it is simply granulated wheat. Thus this breakfast food is known as Suji ka Upma in North India.What really makes an upma recipe special are all the fried and sautéed ingredients that are used for tempering. These ingredients can vary depending on the recipe, but usually include some sweet, savory and nutty flavors.</p></div>
    
    <div id="rec4"><img src="Images/rava dosa.jpg" alt="" width="450px"><h2>Rava Dosa</h2><p>Rava dosa (also known as Suji ka Dosa) is a quick and popular variant of dosa from the South Indian cuisine. These are crispy, netted and thin crepes made with semolina (rava or cream of wheat), rice flour, all purpose flour and spices. These are incredibly easy to make and require no grinding or fermentation, unlike the traditional Dosa Recipe. Make a truly crispy Rava Dosa recipe – one that you will make again and again for a quick breakfast or snack.Rava stands for suji or semolina or cream of wheat. Hence this dosa is named after one of its main ingredients. The type of rava used is the fine variety of rava. You could also use Bombay rava to make these crispy crepes.All the three terms suji, rava, semolina flour and cream of wheat mean the same. In western and southern parts of India, the word ‘rava’ is used. In northern parts of India the word ‘sooji’ or ‘suji’ are used. Thus rava dosa can also be called as ‘suji ka dosa’ or ‘suji dosa’.Together with rava, rice flour and all purpose flour (maida) are also added to the batter. You can make the suji ka dosa plain or you can spice it up by adding chopped onions, curry leaves, herbs and spices.So I usually add onions, ginger, green chilli and some spices to the batter. At times I even add some chopped cashews. The addition of these ingredients makes the dosa more healthy and tasty.Here I am sharing my mom’s rava dosa recipe which is made without curd (yogurt) or buttermilk. Water is used to make the batter.</p></div>

    <div id="rec5"><img src="Images/appam.jpg" alt="" width="600px"><h2>appam</h2><p>Appam (also known as “palappam”) are tasty, lacy and fluffy pancakes or hoppers from the Kerala cuisine that are made from ground, fermented rice and coconut batter. Thin and crispy around the edges with soft fluffy center appam taste delicious when paired with vegetable stew for a hearty vegetarian breakfast. They also just so happen to be gluten-free and vegan.Appam is one of our favorite breakfast dishes, so I make them on the weekends at least once a month. The preparation is similar to making Dosa Batter, and needs some prep work beforehand.Traditionally, appam are fermented with a local alcoholic drink known as toddy – which is a drink made from palm flower or coconut flower.Toddy, which is made from palm flower or coconut flower, is also known as “kallu” in Tamil and Malayalam or “tadi” in Hindi.Since toddy is not readily available everywhere, I make these appam with yeast. Both dry active yeast and instant yeast works as a good fermenting agent and is easy to find the world over. This, however, does not mean that you cannot make appams without yeast.Appam can be made both dry active yeast or instant yeast (rapid rise yeast). I use either depending on what is there on hand. With instant yeast the fermentation time is very less as compared to fermentation with dry active yeast.</p></div>
